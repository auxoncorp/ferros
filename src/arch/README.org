#+TITLE: Cross-Architecture support for Ferros

This module contains the architecture specific details for cross
architecture support in Ferros. In most cases, this support is made
available automatically as ~arch~ conditionally compiles and reÃ«xports
the its enclosed architecture specific items. Those items can be made
available by ~use~-ing ~ferros::arch~.

* Notes on the archtiectures supported by seL4 and Rust
